        The <b> (Gallus gallus domesticus)</b> is a domesticated
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junglefowl">junglefowl</a>
        species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon
        junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeast Asia. Rooster and cock
        are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a
        cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female
        bird is called a hen, and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.
        Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their
        meat and eggs) or as pets. Traditionally they were also bred for
        cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places. Chickens
        domesticated for meat are broilers and for eggs are layers.

        Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals,
        with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,<sup>[2]</sup>[2] up
        from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world
        than any other bird. There are numerous cultural references to
        chickens—in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and literature.
        Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories of
        within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[3] but the clade found
        in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the
        Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to the
        Eastern Mediterranean. They appear in ancient Egypt in the mid-15th
        century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from
        the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of
        Thutmose III.<sup>[4][5][6]</sup> They are known in ancient Greece from
        the 5th century BC.<sup><a href="http://google.com"></a>[7][8]</sup>

        rooster (i.e. a roosting bird) originated in the mid- or late 18th
        century as a euphemism to avoid the sexual connotation of the original
        English cock,[22][23][24] and is widely used throughout North America.
        Roosting is the action of perching aloft to sleep at night.
