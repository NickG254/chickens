      <h1>Auguries of Innocence</h1>
      <p>
        To see a World in a Grain of Sand <br />
        And a Heaven in a Wild Flower <br />
        Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand<br />
        And Eternity in an hour<br />
        A Robin Red breast in a Cage<br />
        Puts all Heaven in a Rage <br />
        A Dove house filld with Doves & Pigeons <br />
        Shudders Hell thr' all its regions <br />
        A dog starvd at his Masters Gate <br />
        Predicts the ruin of the State <br />
        A Horse misusd upon the Road <br />
        Calls to Heaven for Human blood <br />
        Each outcry of the hunted Hare <br />
        A fibre from the Brain does tear <br />
        A Skylark wounded in the wing <br />
        A Cherubim does cease to sing <br />
        The Game Cock clipd & armd for fight <br />
        Does the Rising Sun affright <br />
        Every Wolfs & Lions howl <br />
        Raises from Hell a Human Soul<br />
        The wild deer, wandring here & there <br />
        Keeps the Human Soul from Care <br />
        The Lamb misusd breeds Public Strife<br />
        And yet forgives the Butchers knife <br />
        The Bat that flits at close of Eve <br />
        Has left the Brain that wont Believe<br />
        The Owl that calls upon the Night <br />
        Speaks the Unbelievers fright<br />
        He who shall hurt the little Wren<br />
        Shall never be belovd by Men <br />
        He who the Ox to wrath has movd <br />
        Shall never be by Woman lovd<br />
        The wanton Boy that kills the Fly<br />
        Shall feel the Spiders enmity <br />
        He who torments the Chafers Sprite<br />
        Weaves a Bower in endless Night <br />
        The Catterpiller on the Leaf <br />
        Repeats to thee thy Mothers grief<br />
        Kill not the Moth nor Butterfly <br />
        For the Last Judgment draweth nigh <br />
        He who shall train the Horse to War <br />
        Shall never pass the Polar Bar <br />
        The Beggars Dog & Widows Cat <br />
        Feed them & thou wilt grow fat <br />
        The Gnat that sings his Summers Song<br />
        Poison gets from Slanders tongue <br />
        The poison of the Snake & Newt <br />
        Is the sweat of Envys Foot <br />
        The poison of the Honey Bee <br />
